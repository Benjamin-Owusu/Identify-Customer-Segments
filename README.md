# Identify-Customer-Segments
This repository contains 1 of the projects I completed as part of Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch Nanodegree.

The objective of this project is to identify facet of a particular population (for the data) that are more likely to purchase products for mailout campaign for a mail-order company. The idea is to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, there is the need to assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

### Main steps
- Preprocessing of data
    - Assess Missing Data
    - Selection and Re-Encoding Features
    - Creation of a Cleaning Function
- Feature Transformation
    - Feature Scaling
    - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Clustering
